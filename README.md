# Thesis_fakenews
This is the repository for my thesis project on fake news detection

This repository contains the code (as Jupyter Notebook) required for extracing the subset of the dataset provided by several27 on their repository: https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus. Note that this code already assumes that the imported .csv file is a subset consisting of only fake and real articles. 

This repository also contains the code used for performing the experiments and replicating the results reported in my thesis project. Readability and structure of the code is being improved in the future.
